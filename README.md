**Reflection

The main goal of the project was to use technologies that I'd learned up until this point and to familiarize myself with documentation for new features. 
I chose to use webpack instead of using the create-react-app boilerplate to understand the working and configurations better.

The mainly used technologies in this project are React, React-Router, Redux, Jest and Enzyme, and a significant amount of VanillaJS, JSX, and SCSS.
